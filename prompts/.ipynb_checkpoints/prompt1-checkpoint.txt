Use the resume to draft the first paragraph of a cover letter.  In this first paragraph of your letter, mention the job title for which the applicant is applying. Explain the applicantâ€™s specific interest in the role and company so the reader knows the applicant has done research and has genuine interest. Briefly state the main experience or qualification that makes the applicant a good fit. The first section of the cover letter is the first impression the reader will have of the applicant, so it is important to appeal to that person quickly and succinctly. Keep this paragraph extremely brief. Feel free to use the following format:

I'm excited to apply for the position [position] at [company]; that I found at [source].
I believe my skills in [skills] provide a significant advantage for [reason]. As a longtime fan of your products, I'm thrilled at the opportunity to bring my unique style and passion for [example passion] to the company.
